## 🚀 Quick Start## 🌐🎯 Part 1: Planning and Organizing a Multipage Website



1. **Clone the repository**Before you write any code, take time to plan:

   ```bash

   git clone https://github.com/Mr-kings042/plp-webtechnologies-classroom-july2025-july-2025-final-project-and-deployment-Final-Project-and-Depl.git* Define your website's purpose (portfolio, product showcase, blog, etc.)

   cd plp-webtechnologies-classroom-july2025-july-2025-final-project-and-deployment-Final-Project-and-Depl* Outline 3–5 pages (e.g., Home, About, Services, Contact, Gallery)

   ```* Sketch or describe the layout of each page

* Map out internal navigation (how pages link to one another)

2. **Open in browser**

   - Simply open `index.html` in your browser, or**Goal:** Show intentional structure and user journey across the site.

   - Use a local server: `python -m http.server 8000`
